                What is var, let and const scope?
              </h1>
            </div>

            <p class="text-xl text-gray-500">
              Javascript is a single thread, interpreted programming
              language.and it provides developers with various ways to declare
              variables. Among these are var, let, and const, each with its own
              scope rules and use cases. In this article, we'll explore the
              concept of variable scope in JavaScript and how it differs for
              var, let, and const. But before we will discuss about the scope.
            </p>
            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black">Javascript scope</h1>
            <p class="text-xl text-gray-500">
              Scope defines the area of a program where a variable can be
              accessed or referenced. In JavaScript, there are two main types of
              scope:
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-gray-500">
              <span class="text-2xl text-black font-bold"> 1. Global:</span>
              Variables declared at the top level of a script or outside of any
              function are considered to be in the global scope. These variables
              can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl text-gray-500">
              <span class="text-2xl text-black font-bold"> 2. Function :</span
              >Function scope is also called as the local and block scope.
              Variables declared inside a function or block {} have local scope.
              They are only accessible within that function or block. Outside
              the function can't access the value of the variable.
            </p>
            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black">Var (Function scoped)</h1>
            <p class="text-xl text-gray-500">
              In JavaScript, variables declared with var are function-scoped.
              This means that you can access var form anywhere in the code.A var
              variable is accessible throughout the entire function in which it
              is declared. However, it's important to note that var variables
              are not block-scoped.
            </p>
            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black">Let (Block-Scoped)</h1>
            <p class="text-xl text-gray-500">
              Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), let variables have block scope.
              This means that they are limited to the nearest enclosing block,
              whether it's a function, loop, or any other code block.
            </p>
            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black">Const (Block-Scoped)</h1>
            <p class="text-xl text-gray-500">
              Const is also block scoped but immutable. Like let, const
              variables are block-scoped. However, there's an additional
              feature: once you assign a value to a const variable, you cannot
              reassign it to a new value. It remains constant forever. Also
              cannot declare a variable with the same name again.

            <p class="text-xl text-gray-500">
              In JavaScript, two commonly used values are null and undefined.
              These values often confuse developers due to their similarities,
              but they serve different purposes and have specific use cases. In
              this article, we'll explore when and how to use null and undefined
              effectively in your JavaScript code.

            <div class="space-y-10">
              <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-black">What is "Null"?</h1>
              <p class="text-xl text-gray-500">
                Null defines the absence of value. The variable that defined as
                null it has no value. The simplest definition. For example, let
                number = null; The code above suggests that the number variable
                is empty at the moment and may have a value later.

                  What is REST API?

                A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application
                programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the
                constraints of REST architectural style and allows for
                interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for
                representational state transfer and was created by computer
                scientist Roy Fielding. A REST API, which stands for
                Representational State Transfer Application Programming
                Interface, is a set of rules and conventions for building and
                interacting with web services. It's an architectural style and
                an approach to designing networked applications.

                  >
                  In a REST API, everything is treated as a resource, which can
                  be an object, data, or service. Resources are identified by
                  URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). For example, a REST API for
                  a book store might have resources like /books, /authors, and
                  /categories.

                  >REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform CRUD (Create,
                  Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. The most
                  commonly used HTTP methods in REST are: GET: Retrieve data
                  from the server (Read). POST: Create a new resource on the
                  server (Create). PUT: Update an existing resource on the
                  server (Update). DELETE: Remove a resource from the server

                  Security in REST APIs is often implemented using standard HTTP
                  security mechanisms, such as HTTPS for data encryption and
                  authentication through API keys or tokens. REST APIs are
                  widely used in web development and are the foundation for many
                  web services and web applications. They provide a simple and
                  scalable way to expose and consume data and functionality over
                  the internet, making them a fundamental part of modern web
                  development.
